# LinkedIn Profile Parser

A tiny CLI that turns **offline LinkedIn profile HTML dumps** into tidy JSON â€“ perfect for further analytics or feeding into LLM pipelines.

## Features

* Pureâ€‘Python, zero authentication â€“ works on any HTML you saved with your browser.
* Handles multiple roles at one company, education, headline, about, and recent activity.
* **One JSON per profile** â€“ easy to diff & track.

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone / copy the script then:
pip install -r requirements.txt  # bs4, click, tqdm
```

> Or just `pip install beautifulsoup4 click tqdm lxml` if you donâ€™t use a `requirements.txt`.

---

## Usage

```bash
# General syntax
python linkedin_profile_parser.py [OPTIONS] <INPUTS>...
```

* **`INPUTS`** â€“ One or more paths.  Each path can be:

  * a single `*.html` file, or
  * a directory (all `*.html` within will be processed â€“ nonâ€‘recursive).

* **`-o / --output-dir`** â€“ Target directory for the JSON files.
  *If omitted*, each JSON is written next to its source HTML.

### Parse a single file

```bash
python linkedin_profile_parser.py linkedin_georgi_georgiev.html
```

JSON will be created as `linkedin_georgi_georgiev.json` in the same folder.

### Parse every HTML in a folder

```bash
python linkedin_profile_parser.py ./profiles_html/
```

Each `*.json` drops next to the matching HTML.

### Parse a folder and write JSON elsewhere

```bash
python linkedin_profile_parser.py ./profiles_html/ -o ./json_output/
```

*Creates `./json_output/` if it doesnâ€™t exist.*

## Troubleshooting

* **Parser returns empty fields?** LinkedInâ€™s DOM changes frequently â€“ open an issue with a sample HTML.
* **Multiple roles not grouped?** Make sure the HTML wasnâ€™t truncated during save (scroll all experience before saving).
